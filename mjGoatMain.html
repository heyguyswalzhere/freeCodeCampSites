<p2>

Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[39] During his rookie season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[28] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[40][41][42] Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described him as "the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls" in November,[42] and Jordan appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading "A Star Is Born" in December.[43][44] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[45] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[46] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[45]

What is Jordan’s legacy today? 

</h2>
<p3>
Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.[5] He was also a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant).[206] Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, respectively.[207] By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[208] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in NBA history.[209] He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play,[210] placing him fifth on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant.[210]
